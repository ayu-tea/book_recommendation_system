Tolkien","Genre":"Fantasy","Year of Publication":1954.0,"Publisher":"George Allen & Unwin","Series, Standalone":"Series","Series Name":"The Lord of the Rings","Description":"The Two Towers continues the journey begun in The Fellowship of the Ring, splitting the Fellowship into different paths: Frodo and Sam move toward Mordor, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue Merry and Pippin. The stakes intensify with battles, treachery (notably Saruman\u2019s betrayal), and the growing influence of evil in Middle-earth. The book builds tension via a dual narrative structure, exploring themes of loyalty, corruption, hope, and the burdens of destiny.

Tolkien","Genre":"Fantasy","Year of Publication":1977.0,"Publisher":"George Allen & Unwin","Series, Standalone":"Standalone","Series Name":null,"Description":"The Silmarillion is a mythic history of Tolkien\u2019s universe, covering the creation of the world (Ainulindal\u00eb), the shaping of the Valar and Maiar, the fate of the Silmarils, the rise and fall of N\u00famenor, and stories of Elves, Men, and their struggles across Ages. It is less a continuous narrative than a collection of legendary tales, genealogies, and epic events that form the background for The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien\u2019s son, Christopher Tolkien, edited and compiled the manuscripts after Tolkien\u2019s death to bring coherence to the vast and sometimes fragmentary mythology. The language is more formal, the tone solemn, and the structure more complex than the LOTR trilogy, but it rewards readers with depth, tragedy, beauty, and scale.","Ratings":"4"},{"ISBN Number":"9780778330950","Title":"Lie to Me","Author_ID":223,"Author":"J.T.
